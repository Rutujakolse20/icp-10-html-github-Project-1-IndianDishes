    <p>Maharashtrian food is known for its rich flavors and variety. Rice and jowar (sorghum) are common staples, often served with different lentils and vegetables. Popular dishes include puran poli, a sweet flatbread filled with jaggery and chickpeas, and vada pav, a spicy potato fritter in a bun. Misal pav, a spicy lentil curry with bread, is another favorite. Ingredients like coconut, peanuts, and spices such as turmeric and mustard seeds are often used. From the tangy taste of kokum to the sweet modak enjoyed during festivals, Maharashtrian cuisine offers a delicious mix of simple and complex flavors.</p>

Shaped like small dumplings, modaks are typically made with a soft outer covering of rice flour or wheat flour. They are filled with a delicious mixture of grated coconut and jaggery, flavored with cardamom, which gives them a delightful sweetness and aroma. Some variations may include chopped nuts for added texture. Often offered to Lord Ganesha, modaks symbolize devotion and are cherished for their unique shape and taste.
